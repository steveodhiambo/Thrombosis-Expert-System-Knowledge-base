Paget–Schroetter disease, also known as Paget–von Schrötter disease, is a form of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a medical condition in which blood clots form in the deep veins of the arms. These DVTs typically occur in the axillary or subclavian veins.
Signs and symptoms
The condition is relatively rare.
 It usually presents in young and otherwise healthy patients, and also occurs more often in males than females.
 The syndrome also became known as "effort-induced thrombosis" in the 1960s,
 as it has been reported to occur after vigorous activity,
 though it can also occur due to anatomic abnormality such as clavicle impingement[5] or spontaneously. 
It may develop as a sequela of thoracic outlet syndrome. It is differentiated from secondary causes of upper extremity caused by intravascular catheters.
Paget–Schroetter syndrome was described once for a viola player who suddenly increased practice time 10-fold, 
creating enough repetitive pressure against the brachiocephalic and external jugular veins to cause thrombosis.

Symptoms may include sudden onset of pain, warmth, redness, blueness and swelling in the arm. Diagnosis is usually confirmed with an ultrasound.
 These DVTs have the potential to cause a pulmonary embolism.
