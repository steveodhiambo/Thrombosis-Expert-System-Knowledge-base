Retinal vein occlusion

Retinal vein occlusion is a blockage of the small veins that carry blood away from the retina. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye that converts light images to nerve signals and sends them to the brain.

Causes
Retinal vein occlusion is most often caused by hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and the formation of a blood clot.

Blockage of smaller veins (branch veins or BRVO) in the retina often occurs in places where retinal arteries that have been thickened or hardened by atherosclerosis cross over and place pressure on a retinal vein.

Risk factors for retinal vein occlusion include:

Atherosclerosis
Diabetes
High blood pressure (hypertension)
Other eye conditions, such as glaucoma, macular edema, or vitreous hemorrhage
The risk of these disorders increases with age, therefore retinal vein occlusion most often affects older people.

Blockage of retinal veins may cause other eye problems, including:

Glaucoma (high pressure in the eye), caused by new, abnormal blood vessels growing in the front part of the eye
Macular edema, caused by the leakage of fluid in the retina
