It's highly probable you have Femoral Vein Thrombosis because you tested 100% positive for 
    Fever 
    Swollen leg
    Abdominal swelling

Have you ever heard anyone say the word DVT in reference to your legs and you wondered what they were talking about? DVT stands for deep vein thrombosis. It refers to a blood clot in your veins. These blood clots usually occur in your calf, thigh, or pelvis.

Your femoral vein runs along the inside of your legs from your groin area downward. Femoral vein thrombosis refers to a blood clot present in those veins.
These veins are superficial, or close to the surface of the skin, and are often more prone to blood clots than deeper veins.

Other symptoms of femoral vein thrombosis are similar to symptoms of DVT. They include:

noticeable swelling of your entire leg
tenderness along the veins
abnormal swelling that stays swollen when you press it with your finger, also known as pitting edema
low-grade fever
Additionally, the calf of your affected leg may swell to a size that is more than 3 centimeters greater than the nonaffected leg.

Femoral vein thrombosis can occur as a result of surgery or complications from illness. It can also occur without a known cause or event.
