Thrombosis-Expert-System-Knowledge-Base
====================================================
Using expert system shells for the development of Expert systems. These shells are empty Expert System knowledge bases, which have the structure and interface already written for us; all we need to do is to add the knowledge into the KB. Instead of writing an Expert System from scratch, for this problem we will be using a small Expert System shell to design and implement an expert system. We used PyKnow Framework for building the concerned expert system.
