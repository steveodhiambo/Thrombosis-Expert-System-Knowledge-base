Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is the presence of a blood clot in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body, and seizures.

The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses.[2] Testing may be done to try to determine the underlying cause.

Treatment is typically with anticoagulants (medication that suppresses blood clotting) such as low molecular weight heparin.[1] Rarely thrombolysis (enzymatic destruction of the blood clot) are used. The disease may be complicated by raised intracranial pressure, which may warrant surgical intervention such as the placement of a shunt.

Signs and symptoms
Nine in ten people with sinus thrombosis have a headache; this tends to worsen over the period of several days, but may also develop suddenly (thunderclap headache).[2] The headache may be the only symptom of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.[3] Many patients have symptoms of stroke: inability to move one or more limbs, weakness on one side of the face or difficulty speaking. This does not necessarily affect one side of the body as in the more common "arterial" stroke.[2]

40% of people have seizures, although it is more common in women who develop sinus thrombosis peripartum (in the period before and after giving birth).[4] These are mostly seizures affecting only one part of the body and unilateral (occurring on one side), but occasionally the seizures are generalised and rarely they lead to status epilepticus (persistent or recurrent seizure activity for a long period of time).[2]

In the elderly, many of the aforementioned symptoms may not occur. Common symptoms in the elderly with this condition are otherwise unexplained changes in mental status and a depressed level of consciousness.[5]

The pressure around the brain may rise, causing papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) which may be experienced as visual obscurations. In severely raised intracranial pressure, the level of consciousness is decreased, the blood pressure rises, the heart rate falls and the patient assumes an abnormal posture.

Causes
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is more common in particular situations. 85% of patients have at least one of these risk factors:[2]

Thrombophilia, a tendency to develop blood clots due to abnormalities in coagulation, e.g. factor V Leiden, deficiency of protein C, protein S or antithrombin, or related problems
Nephrotic syndrome, a kidney problem causing protein loss in the urine
Chronic inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, lupus and Behçet's disease
Pregnancy and puerperium (the period after giving birth)
Particular blood disorders, especially polycythemia vera and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
Use of estrogen-containing forms of hormonal contraception
Meningitis and infections of the ear, nose and throat area such as mastoiditis and sinusitis
Direct injury to the venous sinuses
Medical procedures in the head and neck area
Sickle cell anemia
Dehydration, primarily in infants and children
Homocystinuria
Diagnosis
The diagnosis may be suspected on the basis of the symptoms, for example the combination of headache, signs of raised intracranial pressure and focal neurological abnormalities, or when alternative causes of headache and neurological abnormalities, such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage, have been excluded.[2]
