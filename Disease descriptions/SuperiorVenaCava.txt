It's highly probable you have Superior Vena Cava Thrombosis because you tested 100% positive for
    Light headedness
    Headcahe
    Swollen arm
    Neck and face swelling
    Breathing fast


Thrombosis involving a permanent infusion catheter in the subclavian vein and superior vena cava is relatively common, especially in cancer patients. Edema of the arms and head is a well-known clinical consequence of this thrombosis, with an intrinsic risk of pulmonary embolism; however, systemic embolization into the cerebral circulation has not been reported as a sequela. Herein, we describe the case of a 56-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer who developed superior vena cava syndrome due to extensive thrombosis in the presence of a central venous catheter that was used for long-term chemotherapy. The patient's case was complicated by a cerebrovascular accident that was most likely caused by a paradoxical air embolism. A clear mechanism for the embolism was provided by a network of collateral veins, which developed between the brachiocephalic vein and the left atrium due to the superior vena cava obstruction and resulted in a right-to-left shunt. We discuss diagnosis and treatment of the condition in our patient and in general terms.

Permanent indwelling central venous catheters (CVCs) are used in many types of therapeutic interventions. These catheters can be a source of infection and thrombosis. The incidence of CVC-related thrombosis is as high as 30% in adults1; unfortunately, current guidelines are inadequate for preventing this sequela.2,3 Herein, we report the case of a patient with CVC-induced superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome caused by thrombosis. The condition was complicated by apparent paradoxical systemic air embolization. A likely mechanism for embolization was a network of functional collateral veins that had developed between the brachiocephalic vein and the left atrium.
